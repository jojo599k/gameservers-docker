Conan Exiles server

Presently a work in progress.

The game starts with completely default settings, no configuration options
available.

This container can be built from both wine and wine-src images, depending on
your requirements. 

TODO:

* Allow configuration (server name, password, etc etc)
* Export the SQLite DB for saving progress between containers
* Acquire the game so I can test it
